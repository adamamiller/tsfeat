<p>Several important discoveries in astronomy  have happened serendipitously while astronomers were examining other effects. For example, William Herschel discovered Uranus on March 13 1781 (Herschel1857) while surveying bright stars and nearby faint stars. Similarly, Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, Ceres, on January 1 1801 (Serio2001) while compiling a catalog of stars positions. Equally unexpected, was the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, while testing Bell Labs  horn antenna  (Penzias1965). </p>

<p>With the proliferation of data in astronomy and the introduction of automatic methods for classification and characterization, the keen astronomer has been progressively removed from the analysis. Anomalous objects or mechanisms that do not fit the norm are now expected to be discovered systematically: serendipity is now a machine learning task. As a consequence, the astronomer's job is not to be behind the telescope anymore,  but to be capable of selecting and making the interpretation of the increasing amount of data that technology is providing. </p>
